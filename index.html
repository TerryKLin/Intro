					<h3>Experience</h3>
					<p>As a recent Informatics graduate from Dalhousie University, I have substantial experience with both web development and project managment acquired from both community outreach classes and Co-op, which enables me to wear different hats in various conditions.<br>
					Aside from my web development experience, I had also designed and prototyped Dalhousie's admission page in HCI class after conducting extensive user research and focus groups.<br>
					I had been working on a handful on web development projects and a few of them were based on Content Managment Systems (CMS) such as Drupel and WordPress.
