			<h3>Experience</h3>
			<p>As a fourth year Informatics student from Dalhousie University, I have substantial experiences with both web development and project managment, which enables me to wear different heads in various conditions.<br>
			Aside from my web development experiences, I have also oversaw the progress of the group I was assigned in various classes to ensure they met their milestones.</p>
			I have been working on a handful on web development projects and a few of them were based on Content Managment Systems (CMS) such as Drupel and WordPress. In my free time, I'd like to experience new web dev tools such as Lavavel and Stylus. I am currently working on a project for Umbian using Adobe CQ5.
